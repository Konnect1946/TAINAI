There's an innocent expression in its eyes that belies any sense of fear or hostility. Cocking its head in a display of silent curiosity it leans towards you, its heavy tail coiling behind it as it balances itself on the ground.*\r\n\r\n*Its long tongue extends in a delicate curve, reaching out in a gesture that is clearly a greetingâ€”and indeed, the thing appears to be attempting some form of communication with you; perhaps even friendship. It's clear though that it can not speak.*"}

It shifts its weight, the pads of its feet making soft thumping noises against the floor as it sidles closer to you.*\n\n*As it approaches, you hear a soft slapping sound emanating from its side, and realize that the creature has begun to froth slightly at the mouth. This seems to be some kind of response or reaction to your presence.*"}
